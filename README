Overview
========

This PHP application gives web access to your Digikam 1.x photo 
collection.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
You need a working apache webserver with PHP 5 installed.

Make sure PHP's safe_mode is disabled and your webserver has write
permission in the photos/ directory, otherwise PHP won't be able to
write files, and you'll have to do that manually.

PHP 4 will not work, as it cannot open SQLite databases (digikam saves
it's database in SQLite format) and it's Object-Syntax is different.
Feel free to adapt this script to PHP 4 though, should be easy, the
digikam database could be dumped into a mysql database.

Installation
------------
Put the unpacked archive somewhere in your htdocs or public_html folder
so apache can find it

 * Adapt inc/config.inc.php
 * Create a symlink under the phpdigikam folder named "images" pointing 
   to your image collection (or add a corresponding DocumentRoot to 
   Apache configuration).
 * Create a symlink under the phpdigikam folder named "thumbnails" 
   pointing to your ~/.thumbnails/large folder
   (or add a corresponding DocumentRoot to Apache configuration).

Go to
http://localhost/location-of-phpdigikam/albumview.php


About
=====

From Thorben:
This script was written to let others browse my photos and making use of
digikam's great tagging feature, which the ordinary HTML export didn't
offer.

It's very easy to use wget to get the functionality of the export plugin.

It works for me, but I realize this is neither very elegant nor very fast.
Feel free to improve it :-)

From Laurent:
I adapted it to my own needs and made it work with Digikam 1.x. I hope it 
will work for you.
